# My Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills and projects as a Full Stack Developer. The portfolio is designed with a **retro CRT-style theme**, providing a unique user experience. It features responsive layouts and interactive elements, built with modern web technologies.

It also includes basic features such as a information about me, a projects gallery and links to contact me.
